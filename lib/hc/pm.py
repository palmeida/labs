'''
In this module we find the pm distribution on the parliament according to
various methodologies.

def hondt_method( seats, parties ):
    '''
    seat_number - number of seats on the electoral district being considerd
    parties - vote distribution, list in the form:

            'votes': '<number of votes>' },
            ...
            ]

    This function will return the parties list with a new attribute 'result'
    that will contain the number of MPs.

    As described in "Lei 14/79 Artigo 16"
